# Maple Mono Font

> By subframe7536

Downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font?tab=readme-ov-file#install)

Imported as a [TMPro](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@2.0/manual/TextMeshPro/index.html) font asset using this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV4wFb78FFs).

## Usage in Unity

Use the 'Maple Mono' font asset in any text field. It will automatically grab the italic font if you hit the 'I' in the textmeshpro component.
If you'd rather always use the italic version, you can drag that one into the TMPro field too, but this shouldn't be necessary.
